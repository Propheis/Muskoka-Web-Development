              <p>
                I'm a passionate developer and (aspiring) computer scientist. I've been a Queen's student in the <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/students/undergraduate/cogscience/"><abbr title="Computing and Cognitive Science">COGS</abbr></a> Program for <?php echo date("Y") - 2013; ?> years. I have a deep curiosity about the nature of intelligence and how it can be simulated (maybe one day even replicated) in computer systems. I consider myself to be a functionalist. I want to contribute to our scientific understanding of cognition through development on cognitive systems. I believe that the development of cognitive systems will not only advance technology and improve society but also allow us to draw insight into our own minds and their function.
              </p>
              <p>Cognitive Computing is already advancing healthcare, research, and virtually all other aspects of our lives from product recommendation systems to cooking. These advances will help shape and define the world we are living in and I wish to contribute to the progressive development to a better future.</p>

              I was volunteering for <a href="http://queenscodethechange.com">Code the Change</a> as a Project Manager for their annual code jam. I met up with a client and developed a project specification for them. I then oversaw and led the development of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              My client is part of the Engineering Society of Queen's. They wanted us to develop a custom tutoring system for their website. Furthermore, they wanted it to seamlessly integrate with their CMS - WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few days of careful preparation I was ready for the Code Jam. I lead a team of 10 in the development and implementation of this plugin, working on a remote test server so as not to disrupt the client's operations. We got quite a bit done however it was not enough in the 10 hours we had to finish the project. I ended up putting in an additional 30-40 hours myself to finish the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Englinks plugin has since been used by over 800 students, tutors, and administrators, and is still growing steadily in usage daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              They have since contacted me and hired me to continue development of this plugin.

              This is probably the most challenging problem I have ever tackled. It started on a bus ride home to visit my parents when all I had for entertainment was my linguistics textbook and my computer. I started toying around with trying to interpret the meaning of sentences using a simple Python script.
            </p>
            <p>
              The script got complicated in a hurry and I soon realized I should tackle this using a stricter language like C#. I 'translated' my algorithm to C#, and continued development. I hooked into the <a href="http://dictionaryapi.com">Merriam-Webster Inc.</a> API to automatically define and categorize any words I didn't have in my hand-written dictionary. This greatly expanded the vocabulary of my words (by about 250k words!) and enabled me to experiment with totally novel phrases.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few weeks and some helpful tips from my Linguistics Professor <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/llcu/people/faculty/charlotte-reinholtz">Dr. Reinholtz</a>, I had my program able to receive an input phrase and recursively generate tree structures for simple phrases.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was shocked when on one conversation with Dr. Reinholtz I mentioned my program had an issue where it was (so I thought) misclassifying a part of the tree as a Determiner-Phrase rather than a specifier for a Noun-Phrase. It turned out that this was not a bug, but rather a real feature of the English language! My algorithm had predicted a language feature that I didn't know about initially. How cool!
            </p>
            <h3>The long term:</h3>
            <p>
              Eventually I want to begin to experiment with developing an algorithm to analyse a simple question and utilizing this library to generate something of a semantic response. I'd be very interested to see what direction this will take my learning and development of this project.

            <p>
              This project was a great way for me to be introduced to the topic of encryption. It was a programming challenge provided by <a href="http://hackthissite.org">this site</a> whose focus is on teaching basic website security techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge was to take an encrypted document (provided above) and find a way to decrypt it. The only other info I was given was a PHP page where you enter text into a field and it will encrypt it. Using this I was able to identify a pattern based on the ASCII values of the characters. It turned out that the encryption password wasn't <i>really</i> needed. All that was needed was the final integer value calculated from the password, added to each ASCII value for every character in the text.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then did some math to calculate a floor and ceiling value for this magic "salt" that was generated by the password. Then the tool decrypts using each possible password value and whichever one returns a legible result is the correct password. At no point did I ever find out what the password used to encrypt it was, however it didn't matter - I just needed the salt value provided.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusions:</h3>
            <p>
              After doing this exercise (took about 3 or 4 hours), I realized just how vital it is to have good security. If I could do this with no prior knowledge of the XECryption algorithm, imagine what a seasoned veteran could do with a real system. This opened my eyes and taught me to always thoroughly research any project's security implementation and ensure that the product I am delivering is high quality and secure to the best of my knowledge.

            <h3>Oakwood Motel</h3>
            <a href="http://oakwoodmotel.com/"><img src="img/okwd.png" alt="Oakwood Motel's website on launch day"></a>
            <p>
              The Oakwood Motel was my first ever 'client'. My parents who own the place were kind enough to hire me to create their new website. I spent weeks working on this and learned a great deal about websites. The result was a minimalistic and clean look with a rustic feel to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website is fully responsive with basic social media integration and a large focus on SEO. It is powered by WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the website update they saw a 15% increase in traffic in 2 months, and a 22% increase after 6 months. I also implemented a <b>Reservations System</b> that enabled customers to reserve rooms online which opened a whole new channel of revenue for the business. Now they receive almost half of the reservations online during the peak season for tourists.

            <p>
              This salon specializes in hair/makeup services for weddings and was looking for a new platform to display their work and advertise their services. I designed this website for them to post images of their work and find new customers.

            <h3>Muskoka Taekwondo</h3>
            <a href="http://muskokataekwondo.com"><img src="img/mtkd.png" alt="Muskoka Taekwondo's website on launch day"></a>
            <p>
              The owner of Muskoka Taekwondo was a long time friend of mine. Initially he was hesitant to the idea of a website, worried he could not maintain it himself. I assured him that with the <b>WordPress Website</b> I was going to build him he would be able to manage his own content <i>his way</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon completion of the website the owner was ecstatic. The website hooked into <a href="http://madmimi.com">a mass emailing service</a> that automatically sent out formatted newsletters to his students with updates from the dojang. The website also automatically posts to the Facebook page for his business allowing his students to receive notifications from Facebook whenever he had an update for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              He loved this feature, and many of the others I implemented. I caught up with him a year later, and he told me that the primary source of his customers now are from the website, seconded only by word of mouth from all of his happy students!
